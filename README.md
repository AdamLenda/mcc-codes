mcc-codes
=========

A public repository of Merchant Category Codes (MCC) in formats easier to read
than most places (i.e. not a PDF).

The current formats are

* ods (LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org compatible)
* csv
* xls (Microsoft Office & useful with many other systems that can read xls)

Future plans and workflow
=========================
I hope that folks will create pull requests to make this information easier to
read and use. If the pull request is against the CSV I'll gladly update the
binary formats.

I'm building this to benefit the operations and users of http://card.com

We may add more data to this at some point and will share updates.
